5. selfmade linter for check os.Exit() usage in main()

examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs,
such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format
string. It uses heuristics that do not guarantee all reports are
genuine problems, but it can find errors not caught by the compilers.

Registered analyzers:

    SA1000       Invalid regular expression
    SA1001       Invalid template
    SA1002       Invalid format in time.Parse
    SA1003       Unsupported argument to functions in encoding/binary
    SA1004       Suspiciously small untyped constant in time.Sleep
    SA1005       Invalid first argument to exec.Command
    SA1006       Printf with dynamic first argument and no further arguments
    SA1007       Invalid URL in net/url.Parse
    SA1008       Non-canonical key in http.Header map
    SA1010       (*regexp.Regexp).FindAll called with n == 0, which will always return zero results
    SA1011       Various methods in the 'strings' package expect valid UTF-8, but invalid input is provided
    SA1012       A nil context.Context is being passed to a function, consider using context.TODO instead
    SA1013       io.Seeker.Seek is being called with the whence constant as the first argument, but it should be the second
    SA1014       Non-pointer value passed to Unmarshal or Decode
    SA1015       Using time.Tick in a way that will leak. Consider using time.NewTicker, and only use time.Tick in tests, commands and endless functions
    SA1016       Trapping a signal that cannot be trapped
    SA1017       Channels used with os/signal.Notify should be buffered
    SA1018       strings.Replace called with n == 0, which does nothing
    SA1019       Using a deprecated function, variable, constant or field
    SA1020       Using an invalid host:port pair with a net.Listen-related function
    SA1021       Using bytes.Equal to compare two net.IP
    SA1023       Modifying the buffer in an io.Writer implementation
    SA1024       A string cutset contains duplicate characters
    SA1025       It is not possible to use (*time.Timer).Reset's return value correctly
    SA1026       Cannot marshal channels or functions
    SA1027       Atomic access to 64-bit variable must be 64-bit aligned
    SA1028       sort.Slice can only be used on slices
    SA1029       Inappropriate key in call to context.WithValue
    SA1030       Invalid argument in call to a strconv function
    SA2000       sync.WaitGroup.Add called inside the goroutine, leading to a race condition
    SA2001       Empty critical section, did you mean to defer the unlock?
    SA2002       Called testing.T.FailNow or SkipNow in a goroutine, which isn't allowed
    SA2003       Deferred Lock right after locking, likely meant to defer Unlock instead
    SA3000       TestMain doesn't call os.Exit, hiding test failures
    SA3001       Assigning to b.N in benchmarks distorts the results
    SA4000       Binary operator has identical expressions on both sides

    SA4004       The loop exits unconditionally after one iteration
    SA4005       Field assignment that will never be observed. Did you mean to use a pointer receiver?
    SA4006       A value assigned to a variable is never read before being overwritten. Forgotten error check or dead code?
    SA4008       The variable in the loop condition never changes, are you incrementing the wrong variable?
    SA4009       A function argument is overwritten before its first use
    SA4010       The result of append will never be observed anywhere
    SA4011       Break statement with no effect. Did you mean to break out of an outer loop?
    SA4012       Comparing a value against NaN even though no value is equal to NaN
    SA4013       Negating a boolean twice (!!b) is the same as writing b. This is either redundant, or a typo.
    SA4014       An if/else if chain has repeated conditions and no side-effects; if the condition didn't match the first time, it won't match the second time, either
    SA4015       Calling functions like math.Ceil on floats converted from integers doesn't do anything useful
    SA4016       Certain bitwise operations, such as x ^ 0, do not do anything useful
    SA4017       A pure function's return value is discarded, making the call pointless
    SA4018       Self-assignment of variables
    SA4019       Multiple, identical build constraints in the same file
    SA4020       Unreachable case clause in a type switch

    SA4023       Impossible comparison of interface value with untyped nil
    SA4024       Checking for impossible return value from a builtin function
    SA4025       Integer division of literals that results in zero
    SA4026       Go constants cannot express negative zero
    SA4027       (*net/url.URL).Query returns a copy, modifying it doesn't change the URL
    SA4028       x % 1 is always zero
    SA4029       Ineffective attempt at sorting slice
    SA4030       Ineffective attempt at generating random number
    SA4031       Checking never-nil value against nil
    SA5000       Assignment to nil map
    SA5001       Deferring Close before checking for a possible error
    SA5002       The empty for loop ('for {}') spins and can block the scheduler
    SA5003       Defers in infinite loops will never execute
    SA5004       'for { select { ...' with an empty default branch spins
    SA5005       The finalizer references the finalized object, preventing garbage collection
    SA5007       Infinite recursive call
    SA5008       Invalid struct tag
    SA5009       Invalid Printf call
    SA5010       Impossible type assertion
    SA5011       Possible nil pointer dereference
    SA5012       Passing odd-sized slice to function expecting even size
    SA6000       Using regexp.Match or related in a loop, should use regexp.Compile
    SA6001       Missing an optimization opportunity when indexing maps by byte slices
    SA6002       Storing non-pointer values in sync.Pool allocates memory
    SA6003       Converting a string to a slice of runes before ranging over it
    SA6005       Inefficient string comparison with strings.ToLower or strings.ToUpper
    SA9001       Defers in range loops may not run when you expect them to
    SA9002       Using a non-octal os.FileMode that looks like it was meant to be in octal.
    SA9003       Empty body in an if or else branch
    SA9004       Only the first constant has an explicit type
    SA9005       Trying to marshal a struct with no public fields nor custom marshaling
    SA9006       Dubious bit shifting of a fixed size integer value
    SA9007       Deleting a directory that shouldn't be deleted
